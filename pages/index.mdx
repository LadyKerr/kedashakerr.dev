## Hey, I'm Kedasha Kerr ✨

### I'm a Software Developer 👩🏽‍💻, Technical Content Creator 🎥 and Speaker 🎤.

I currently work at GitHub as a Developer Advocate, where I get to share my learnings with the dev community.
I enjoy **teaching**, **creating** and **building** with other developers and especially enjoy creating video content.
I share technical content on Tiktok, Instagram, Linkedin and sometimes Twitter.
