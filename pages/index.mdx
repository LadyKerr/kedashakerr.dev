# Kedasha Kerr ✨

Hey, I'm Kedasha and I'm a Software Developer! 👩🏽‍💻

I currently work at GitHub as a Developer Advocate, where I get to share my learnings with the dev community.
I enjoy **teaching**, **creating** and **building** with other developers in the community and especially enjoy creating video content.
I share technical content on Tiktok, Instagram, Linkedin and sometimes Twitter.

<div style={{ display: "flex"}}>
    <Image
        src="/images/me_copilot.jpg"
        alt="Photo"
        width={1125}
        height={750}
        priority
        className="next-image"
    />

</div>

### Catch me on social media where I share all my learnings, growings and pains.
